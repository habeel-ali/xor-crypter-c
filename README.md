# Simple XOR Encrpyter & Decrypter
This C program is a simple file encryption utility that uses XOR encryption.

### Example Usage
To use the program, you would compile it (e.g., `gcc -o encrypter encrypter.c`) and run it from the command line, specifying the path to the file you want to encrypt. For example:
#####  `./encrypter myfile.txt`

You will then be prompted to enter an encryption key. The program will create a file named `myfile.txt-encrypted` with the encrypted content.
